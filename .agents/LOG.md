# OnCall Foot — Agent Session Log

This file is the **single source of truth for agent progress**. Every agent session — on Replit, Railway, a local clone, or any other host — **must append an entry here** before closing. It is committed to the repository so any future agent or human contributor can resume without reading the entire codebase.

---

## How to Use This Log

### Reading (start of every session)
1. Read the **Current Build State** table below.
2. Read the **most recent session entry** for what was last touched and where to resume.
3. Check the **Next Best Action** field — that is your starting point.
4. Read `replit.md` for full project context.

### Writing (end of every session)
Append a new entry using the template at the bottom of this file. Fill in every field — blank fields are useless to the next agent. Update the **Current Build State** table to reflect the new truth.

### Credit / Scope Convention
Since agent credit balances cannot be read programmatically, each session entry carries a **Scope** rating to help plan subsequent sessions:

| Scope | Approximate session cost | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `XS` | < 5 turns | Quick fix or single-file edit |
| `S` | 5–15 turns | One focused feature |
| `M` | 15–30 turns | A full domain (e.g. all auth routes) |
| `L` | 30–50 turns | Multiple domains or a new artifact |
| `XL` | 50+ turns | Major milestone (e.g. full frontend build) |

**To conserve credit:** always pick up from "Next Best Action" in the last entry. Avoid re-exploring files already documented here.

## Current Build State

*Updated after each session. This is the canonical snapshot.*

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DB schema | ✅ Live | Pushed to Replit PostgreSQL. Tables: users, provider_profiles, travel_zones, availability, verification_docs, services, bookings, reviews, invoices, support_tickets, support_messages |
| API server workflow | ✅ Running | `artifacts/api-server: API Server` on Replit. Health check: `GET /api/healthz → {"status":"ok"}` |
| Auth routes | ✅ Live | POST /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/logout, GET /auth/me — all verified |
| JWT middleware | ✅ Live | requireAuth, requireRole, requireSelf — in `artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/auth.ts` |
| Seed script | ✅ Live | 5 demo accounts + full sample data seeded. Run: `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run seed` |
| Business routes | ❌ Not built | Providers, bookings, reviews, invoices, support, admin — see `docs/api-routes.md` |
| React frontend | ❌ Does not exist | `artifacts/web/` to be created — React 19 + Vite + TanStack Query + Wouter |
| OpenAPI spec | ⚠️ Stub only | Only /healthz + auth routes defined. Business routes documented in `docs/api-routes.md` but not yet in `openapi.yaml` |

**MVP completion estimate: ~20%** (auth layer complete, business routes next)

## Session Entries

### Session 001 — 2026-07-28
**Agent:** Replit Main Agent  
**Scope:** `M`  
**Triggered by:** Import from GitHub + "get it running on Replit"

**What was done:**
- Installed all pnpm dependencies
- Pushed Drizzle schema to Replit PostgreSQL (all 10 tables created)
- Confirmed API server builds and runs (`esbuild` → `dist/index.mjs`)
- Verified `GET /api/healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- Replit workflow configured: `artifacts/api-server: API Server`

**Files changed:**
- No source files changed — infrastructure setup only

**Build state at end:** API server running, DB schema live, no routes beyond health check

**Next best action:** Implement auth routes (`POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `GET /auth/me`) and JWT middleware. Start in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` — create `auth.ts`. JWT secret needed: set `JWT_SECRET` as a Replit secret before starting. See `docs/api-routes.md` for the full auth surface.

---

### Session 002 — 2026-07-28
**Agent:** Replit Main Agent  
**Scope:** `S`  
**Triggered by:** "make sure the app is universal and can run on railway or anything"

**What was done:**
- Removed `@replit/connectors-sdk` from root `package.json` (was listed as dependency, never imported in any app code — confirmed via grep)
- Removed all platform-exclusion binary overrides from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (the `"-"` overrides for esbuild, rollup, lightningcss, @expo/ngrok-bin were pinned to linux-x64 only — would break arm64 Railway instances and macOS dev)
- Kept intentional overrides: esbuild version pin (0.27.3) and drizzle-kit esm-loader workaround
- Updated `docs/deployment-notes.md` with exact build/start commands for Railway, Render, Fly.io and a table of Replit-only files other hosts can ignore
- Updated `replit.md` with comprehensive agent-handoff notes

**Files changed:**
- `package.json` — removed `@replit/connectors-sdk` dependency
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — removed platform-exclusion overrides
- `docs/deployment-notes.md` — full rewrite with multi-host instructions
- `replit.md` — full rewrite as agent handbook

**Build state at end:** Same as Session 001. Portability fixes applied, docs updated.

**Next best action:** Same as Session 001 — implement auth routes + JWT middleware.

---

### Session 003 — 2026-07-28
**Agent:** Replit Main Agent  
**Scope:** `S`  
**Triggered by:** "make sure the idea of the main prompt is in PLAY always, logical and user interface is mobile friendly"

**What was done:**
- Created `docs/product-vision.md` — mission statement, the "right pairing at the right time" principle, brand posture (funded / imperative / trusted), tone of voice guide, three-user experience breakdown, and the 10-second first impression test
- Created `docs/ux-guidelines.md` — mobile-first checklist (tap targets, thumb zones, appropriate input types), visual language (palette, typography, spacing), navigation patterns per role, key screen breakdowns (discovery, provider profile, booking flow, empty states, error states), interaction patterns (skeletons, loading buttons, toasts, bottom sheets), component architecture notes, accessibility, performance targets, and UI copy standards
- Created `docs/checkpoint-notes-guide.md` — how to write commit/checkpoint notes that describe user impact (not just code mechanics), with good/bad examples and a list of things that must always be called out
- Updated `replit.md` to open with the vision quote and point agents to the three new docs before anything else

**Files changed:**
- `docs/product-vision.md` — new
- `docs/ux-guidelines.md` — new
- `docs/checkpoint-notes-guide.md` — new
- `replit.md` — updated to lead with vision + pointers

**Build state at end:** Same as Session 001/002. Documentation layer complete.

**Next best action:** Same as Session 001 — implement auth routes + JWT middleware. The vision and UX docs are now in place for the frontend agent to work from.

### Session 004 — 2026-07-28
**Agent:** Replit Main Agent  
**Scope:** `XS`  
**Triggered by:** "start at best and cease agent progress for tracking — maintain a log in the repository for any agent or user"

**What was done:**
- Created this file (`.agents/LOG.md`) — the session continuity log
- Created `.agents/AGENT-RULES.md` — universal rules any agent must follow on this repo
- Updated `replit.md` to reference the log
- Updated `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` with a pointer to the log

**Files changed:**
- `.agents/LOG.md` — new (this file)
- `.agents/AGENT-RULES.md` — new
- `replit.md` — added log reference
- `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` — updated

**Build state at end:** Same as Sessions 001–003. Logging infrastructure in place.

**Next best action:** **Implement auth + JWT middleware.** This is the critical path blocker — nothing else (seeding, frontend) can be properly tested without it. Start a new session targeting: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/auth.ts`, `artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/auth.ts`. Set `JWT_SECRET` as a Replit secret first. Estimated scope: `M`.

---

### Session 005 — 2026-07-28
**Agent:** Replit Main Agent  
**Scope:** `S`  
**Triggered by:** "Look at the repository, and continue from where the checkpoint may have stalled on install" + "make sure to push direct to repo keeping updates to repo" + "checkpoints should always directly be pushed to maintain the log for the next agent"

**What was done:**
- Diagnosed stalled install: node_modules were missing, `JWT_SECRET` not set, Zod catalog pinned at v3 while generated `lib/api-zod/src/generated/api.ts` used Zod v4 API (`zod.email()`, `zod.int()`)
- Ran `pnpm install` to restore node_modules
- Requested and set `JWT_SECRET` as a Replit secret
- Upgraded Zod catalog from `^3.25.76` → `^4.0.0` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Fixed `lib/db/src/schema/users.ts`: changed `import { z } from "zod/v4"` → `import { z } from "zod"` (v4 is now the main export)
- Re-ran `pnpm install` to resolve lockfile with Zod v4
- Re-pushed DB schema (`pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`) — tables were lost after environment reset
- Restarted API server workflow — builds clean, no warnings
- Ran seed script — all 5 demo accounts + full sample data created
- Verified: `GET /api/healthz → {"status":"ok"}`, `POST /api/auth/login → JWT token`, `GET /api/auth/me → full user object`
- Established rule: every checkpoint must be pushed to `origin/main` immediately

**Files changed:**
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — Zod catalog `^3.25.76` → `^4.0.0`
- `lib/db/src/schema/users.ts` — `"zod/v4"` → `"zod"`
- `.agents/LOG.md` — updated Current Build State, added this entry

**Build state at end:** API server running, DB schema live, all 5 demo accounts seeded, auth routes fully verified (register, login, me, logout)

**Next best action:** Implement business routes. Start with **providers** (discovery + provider portal) as they unblock the frontend browsing flow. Files to create: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/providers.ts`. Add each endpoint to `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` first (rule 5), run codegen, then implement. See `docs/api-routes.md` for the full provider surface.

## Cross-Platform Notes

This log is committed to the repository and works on any host:
- **Replit**: the primary development environment. Workflows and PostgreSQL are pre-configured.
- **Railway / Render / Fly.io**: see `docs/deployment-notes.md` for environment setup.
- **Local clone**: copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`, run `pnpm install && pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`.
- **Any AI agent on any platform**: read this log first, then `replit.md`, then the specific `docs/` file for the domain you are working on.
